Rocket.Chat is a Web Chat Server, developed in JavaScript, using the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) fullstack framework.

It is a great solution for communities and companies wanting to privately host their own chat service or for developers looking forward to build and evolve their own chat platforms.
